# Official answer:
Computer memory, also known as RAM, is a linear bank of bits (1s and 0s) which store data on your computer. The bits are divided into "words" which are dependent on the chip architecture: For example, a 32-bit processor's words are 32 bits each. Unlike hard drives, memory requires a power source to run. Memory can be accessed in O(1) time.

Ryan - Memory has long term storage and RAM (working memory). It is 0's and 1's of electrical current.

Luke - Data is made up of a sequence of 0s and 1s. The length depends on the architecture of the processor. The data have addresses which are stored in RAM and you can point to the location and its value.

Whit - Computer memory has 2 diff types: hard drives & RAM. RAM is for memory currently in use. Memory is comprised of cells (1s & 0s) that create sequences called words. Each word has a memory address (pointer/reference) in which it can be found. The number of cells in a word depends on the default size of the processor--so a 8-bit will have 8 cells per word; 64-bit will have 64 cells per word.
