# Official answer:
Computer memory, also known as RAM, is a linear bank of bits (1s and 0s) which store data on your computer. The bits are divided into "words" which are dependent on the chip architecture: For example, a 32-bit processor's words are 32 bits each. Unlike hard drives, memory requires a power source to run. Memory can be accessed in O(1) time.

# Brett Hageft
Computer memory is dynamically allocated space where values can be stored and retrieved by address.


# Marvin Lewis  
Computer memory is comprised of memory cells that hold a positive charge or no charge. The positive charge represents one and the no charge represents zero. Each cell holds 2 values known as a bit and 8 bits represent a byte.

# Seth Holland   
memory, referred to as RAM or Random Access Memory, is like a string of cells.  Each cell can either hold the value 1 or 0.  Cells are divided up in to words, which the length of each word is determined by the operating system.  When memory is required by a program, the CPU assigns a chuck of words to the task and gives it a location.  Once the current program is finished, the allocated memory block becomes available for the next task.  If an active power source is not available, all memory is cleared.

# John Lee   
Computer memory is composed of chunks of bits, ones and zeroes, that form bytes, usually in groups of eight. The ones and zeroes themselves represent the presence or lack of a current through the cell corresponding with the bit. The various possible combinations of ones and zeroes within each byte represent the current state of information the computer is working with. Some of these bytes will serve as references to other bytes, while many will represent pieces of information such as integers and strings, with others still holding metadata for various data types.

# Aaron Brubeck   
Memory contains circuits that will have a charge or it will not. Your cpu determines how many bits it can access, so if you have an 8-bit cpu you are accessing 8-bits at a time or 1 byte. RAM consists of logic gates made of transistors triggered by the cpu when it is writing information. The memory is addressed (possibly) in a binary tree type format to locate the information. So your cpu looks at which RAM stick then which quarter of the ram stick it is on then it keeps dividing until it gets to the 8 bits of information it at that address and either reads or writes to it. It is also volatile.

# Shannon Zander   
Memory is any physical device capable of storing information. Information put into memory is written, and information pulled from memory is read. Memory is stored using integrated circuits, storing information in bits comprised of charge or no charge. Memory can be temporary or permanent, volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memory would be the type of memory where a power loss results in a loss of data (think RAM), whereas non-volatile memory would not result in data loss in the absence of power (think ROM).

Computer memory, is a linear bank of bits (1s and 0s) which store data on my computer.

# Tommy Forde   
Memory (random access memory) is like short term memory for a computer. Stored slices of memory (or words) are of a set size defined by the cpuâ€™s architecture. The system hands out chunks of a set size, requested by a program currently running. The data stored in memory itself are 1s and 0s (charge or no charge), and are normally grouped into chunks of 8 (also a byte).

# Chloe Baylock    
Memory is what stores values in a machine using electric charges. If there is a charge its binary value is a 1, if there is no charge its value is 0. Each value's memory address is where it is indexed in the machine.

# Allen Z 
Computer Memory (RAM) is the storage space in the computer where it stores instructions and data to be processed. The speed and performance of the computer can depend on how much space is left in memory.
