## Welcome to Module 2!

## How to use this repo

This repo has templates for practices and study guides. Students should use their own cohort specific branch. Solutions and cohort specific work will come from their respective branch.

---

## Setup

To clone the repo run this command in the directory of your choice:

    git clone -b <your-cohort-branchname> --single-branch <remote-repo-url>

- `<your-cohort-branchname>` will follow the format of __your cohort's__ `Year-Month-Cohort` (e.g., `2021-November-Cohort`).

- `<remote-repo-url>` will depend on if you are using SSH or PAT to access GitHub.

Examples:

- Cloning (using PAT) may look like:

        git clone -b 2021-November-Cohort --single-branch https://github.com/appacademy/Module-2-Resources.git

- Cloning (using SSH) may look like:

        git clone -b 2021-November-Cohort --single-branch git@github.com:appacademy/Module-2-Resources.git
