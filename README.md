## Welcome to Module 2!

In this module, you will learn the following:

---

## Instructions on how to use this repo

This repo has templates for practices and study guides. Students should use their own cohort specific branch. Solutions and cohort specific work will come from their respective branch.


---

## Setup

To clone the repo run this command in the directory of your choice:

    git clone -b <your-cohort-branchname> <remote-repo-url>

`<your-cohort-branchname>` will follow the format of ___your cohort's___ `Year-Month-Cohort`, e.g., `2021-November-Cohort`.

`<remote-repo-url>` will depend on if you are using SSH or PAT to access GitHub

Cloning (using PAT) may look like:

    git clone -b 2021-November-Cohort https://github.com/appacademy/Module-2-Resources.git

Cloning (using SSH) may look like:

    git clone -b 2021-November-Cohort git@github.com:appacademy/Module-2-Resources.git
