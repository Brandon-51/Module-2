# Be able to:

- describe a logarithmic function and it's behavior
- describe bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort by their behavior and why they may be problematic


-bubble sort: algorithm that sorts an array by looking at adjacent pairs and reorders them if they are not in correct order. Larger elements bubble up to the top.
time complexity: O(n^2)
space complexity: O(1)

-insertion sort: algorithm incrementally places values from an unsorted array in the correct position in a sorted array
time complexity: O(n^2)
space complexity: O(1)

-selection sort: algorithm incrementally moves the smallest values from an unsorted array to a sorted array
time complexity: O(n^2)
space complexity: O(1)
